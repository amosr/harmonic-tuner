# Harmonic tuner

[Visit the harmonic tuner website.](https://music.amospheric.com/tuner)

This is a web-based tuner, specifically designed for tuning the harmonics on percussion instruments. The user selects a specific frequency (eg A3/220Hz) and a set of harmonics (eg 1,4,10 for vibraphones), and the tuner is sensitive to frequencies near those specific pitches (eg 220Hz, 880Hz and 2200Hz). Unlike a regular chromatic tuner that displays the pitch of the fundamental frequency, this form of tuner can be used in a loud environment such as while working with power tools. It is similar to a strobe tuner, though I couldn't find a strobe tuner that let me choose specific frequencies (eg the just ratio 16/11 of 384Hz)
